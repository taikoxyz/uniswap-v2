# UniswapV2 contracts and deployments
UniswapV2 contracts

This is needed Gwyneth testing.
Currently available repository: https://github.com/taikoxyz/uniswap-v2-deploy was good till today, but it is lacking smart contracts (deploys from bytecode) and thus smart contract verification is impossible that way.
